			Hi, I am a Computer Engineering student at <a class="main-link" href="/college">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> in Troy, NY. <br><br>
			When not working on my next programming project, you can find me taking photos, enjoying the outdoors, doing community service, working on puzzles of any and all sorts, or reading a good book. During the year, you might be able to find me working with the <a class="main-link" href="/projects#RCOS">Rensselear Center for Open Source</a> or <a class="main-link" href="/college#EHC">Embedded Hardware Club</a>.  Else, I'm probably off working with the other brothers of my Service Fraternity, <a class="main-link" href="/college">Alpha Phi Omega</a>, helping out around campus or in the local community.<br><br> This summer, you will find me at my internship working with <a class="main-link" href="/work#verizon">Verizon's Cloud Computing</a> team in Lowell, Massachusetts.
