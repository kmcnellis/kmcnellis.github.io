					I was a member of the hypervisor team, developing the compute backend for cloud hosting. I designed and implemented a system to automatically export the memory dumps and log files off of crashed hypervisors, onto a long-term and permanant storage platform to enable the developers and maintaners to be able to more efficiently and easily debug and recover from problems, without impacting the production environment and resources. I also helped implement a system and dev-ops tools for long term secure secret key management across releases.

					During the school year, I work as a software developer for RCOS, a student run program that organizes undergraduates to work on various open source projects and provides resources and support for them. Currently, I am working on creating an online <a class="main-link" href="/projects#HWserver">programming homework submission server</a> for the computer science department.
